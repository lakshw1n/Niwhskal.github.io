### Hello there!

Welcome to my online home. You'll find most of my thoughts here. I write about Machine Learning research, ideas that I've come up with while staring at abstract objects in my room, nonsensical experiments, and occasionally art. I'm quite fickle in my interests, so there's always something different. Make yourself comfortable in the comments section. I'm constantly looking to have diverse conversations, so if you're feeling like it, drop me an email. 

Glad to have you here :)
